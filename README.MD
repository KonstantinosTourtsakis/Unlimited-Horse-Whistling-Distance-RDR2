# Unlimited Horse Whistling Distance (Red Dead Redemption 2)
Source code of Unlimited Horse Whistling Distance mod

## Description
This is the source code of my Red Dead Redemption 2 mod "Unlimited Horse Whistling Distance". The source code has been released for educational purposes. New modders can learn from the source and understand modding through this code.

## Mod Description
This mod brings back a feature from the first Redemption title which allowed the player to call his horse at an unlimited distance range.
You will no longer have to reach your horse to call it again.

## Source information
The source code is built on top of the "Pools" source provided with Alexander Blade's ScriptHookSDK. I'm using that same Project name because I sometimes work on multiple mods at the same time, so reloading scripts is easier and safer due to the fact that there is only one mod installed during that specific game session. Therefore, the compiled .asi file is named Pools.asi. The file can be renamed later.

## Installation
#### Requirements: [Alexander Blade's ScriptHookRDR2](http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/)
- Copy "Pools.asi" file under /samples/Pools/bin/Release/ directory to your Red Dead Redemption 2 game folder.
- Done!
